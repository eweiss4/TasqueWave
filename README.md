# TasqueWave
TasqueWave is a task management system that tries to make task management easy to do. This cuts down on multiple screens and relies on non-intrusive pop-ups with an easy approach to constantly reference and change those tasks with just staying on a single screen.
TasqueWave leverages Flask and SQL to deliver a simplified, casual task management experience that is more catered towards everyday life rather than most other task management systems that gear towards professional development.
